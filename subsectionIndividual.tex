\subsection{Individual growth rates}

Following \citep{lenski:AmNat:1991} we measure the Malthusian growth parameters of each individual strain.
We calculate the dynamics of individual yeast strains as they grow, independently with each having a carrying capacity of $K$.
Thus the general dynamics can be represented can be captured by the standard logistic equations given by

\begin{equation}
	\dot{x}_i = s_i x_i (1 - x_i/K) 
\end{equation}

and for two types grown together this is denoted by

\begin{eqnarray}
	\dot{x}_{ia} = (r_{ia \rightarrow ia } x_{ia} + r_{ib \rightarrow ia } x_{ib})  (1 - (x_{ia}+x_{ib})/K) \nonumber \\
	\dot{x}_{ib} = (r_{ia \rightarrow ib } x_{ia} + r_{ib \rightarrow ib } x_{ib}) (1 - (x_{ia}+x_{ib})/K)
\end{eqnarray}
and we denote the frequency of this community by $x_i = x_{ia} + x_{ib}$.
Comparing the model together with the data we see that the model dynamics captures well the population dynamics of the single inoculums as well as the community expansion.
