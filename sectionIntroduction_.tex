\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Why we need a simplified system}

Ecological networks are complex.
Disentangling and understanding this complexity can be done at an abstract level employing information theory or network analysis.
While this provides us with general properties of the interactions it is often impossible to pin down the principles which form the building blocks.
One approach is to start with a simpler system with defined nature and number of interactions.
Synthetically engineered communities are one way of achieving this \citep{momeni:elife:2013}
